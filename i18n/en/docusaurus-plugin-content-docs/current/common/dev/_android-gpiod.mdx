## GPIOD Introduction

The GPIO sysfs interface has been deprecated since Linux 4.8. Userspace should instead use `libgpiod` to interact with GPIO character devices.

### Key features

- Easy to use: `libgpiod` provides a simple API that makes controlling and operating GPIO devices easy to understand. Developers only need to understand basic GPIO concepts and function interfaces to use it.
- Efficient Event Listening: `libgpiod` provides functionality for asynchronous event listening, such as waiting for GPIO state changes. This allows developers to implement efficient event-driven applications.
- GPIO specification support: `libgpiod` provides support for different GPIO specifications and numbering methods, including GPIO numbering and physical pin numbering.

### Command Line Tools

`libgpiod` provides a variety of command line tools, for viewing and control GPIO devices.

#### `gpiodetect`

List all GPIO controllers in the system:

```bash
radxa：/$ gpiodetect
gpiochip0 [gpio0] (32 lines)
gpiochip1 [gpio1] (32 lines)
gpiochip2 [gpio2] (32 lines)
gpiochip3 [gpio3] (32 lines)
gpiochip4 [gpio4] (32 lines)
```

#### `gpioinfo`

Display GPIO device information:

```bash
radxa：/$ gpioinfo
gpiochip0 - 85 lines:
        line   0:     "PIN_27"       unused   input  active-high
        line   1:     "PIN_28"       unused   input  active-high
        line   2:      "PIN_7"       unused   input  active-high
        line   3:     "PIN_11"       unused   input  active-high
        line   4:     "PIN_13"       unused   input  active-high
        line   5:     "PIN_15"       unused   input  active-high
        line   6:     "PIN_18"       unused   input  active-high
        line   7:     "PIN_40"       unused   input  active-high
        line   8:      unnamed       unused   input  active-high
        line   9:      unnamed       unused   input  active-high
...
```

When using the 'libgpiod' command-line tool to control GPIO, ensure that GPIO is in an unused state
:::

#### `gpioget`

Set GPIO to input mode and obtain the input status of GPIO:

```bash
radxa：/$ gpioget gpiochip0 0
1
```

#### `gpioset`

Set GPIO to output mode and set the output status of GPIO:

```bash
radxa：/$ gpioset gpiochip0 0=1
```

#### `gpiomon`

Monitor GPIO events:

```bash
radxa：/$ gpiomon gpiochip0 0
(GPIO event output)
```
